## About WUZZLE - a wordle clone :

Wordle is an online 5-letter word game. Each day a new word is released and players have six attempts to guess what the word of the day is. During the guesses, tiles will change colour to help players get the word. A grey letter means it isn’t in today’s word, whilst a yellow letter signals it is in the word but in the wrong position. Then there’s the green letter which means it’s in the word and in the right place.

Players select letters of the alphabet on the virtual keyboard and enter them into the 5 blank tiles. When they’re happy with their 5-letter word guess, they press the submit button. This then checks the word and lets you know if your word or some of the letters are correct. If it’s completely right – the full 5 letters turn green.

If you correctly guess the word within the 6 attempts, then you win the game.
